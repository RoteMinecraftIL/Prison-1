# Introduction
Prison is a plugin for the Minecraft Bukkit platform that aims to provide all the
systems that a Prison server needs in one plugin. There are numerous benefits towards this.
* No longer do you have to wait for seperate plugins to update before updating
your Prison server.
* They work seemlessly together for the best experience.
* They have similar user interfaces, which allows you to better utilize your intuition.

Prison v3.0 is a recode of the project that aims to further the usability and stability of the plugin.
