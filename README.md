# Prison

Prison is an awesome Bukkit plugin for CraftBukkit / Spigot 1.8. It combines the mines and ranks systems essential to Prison servers into **one plugin** and allows you to set both of them up in a **very simple way**. It can be downloaded on [Bukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mcprison/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prison.1223/). *Betas* can be found [here](http://github.com/SirFaizdat/Prison/releases).

## Prison v2.2
Prison v3.0 has been delayed, so for Minecraft 1.9 a new version of Prison will be released.
It will contain new features such as a simplified user interface, better save system, localization,
more reliable rankups, re-added features (that were removed in the past, such as mine protection), and more.
