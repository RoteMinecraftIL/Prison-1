Prison is an awesome Bukkit plugin for CraftBukkit / Spigot 1.8. It combines the mines and ranks systems essential to Prison servers into **one plugin** and allows you to set both of them up in a **very simple way**. It can be downloaded on [Bukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mcprison/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prison.1223/). *Betas* can be found [here](http://github.com/SirFaizdat/Prison/releases).

## Prison v3.0
Prison 3 is coming. It is a totally redone plugin with support for Sponge, Spigot, and Minecraft Forge. It lives on its own branch, [here](https://github.com/SirFaizdat/Prison/tree/3.0).
